    DingTalk provides two types of robots: internal enterprise robots and custom robots.
    This field expects the webhook URL generated for your robot.
    It looks like <code>https://oapi.dingtalk.com/robot/send?access_token=...</code>
    and should be kept secret.
  </p>
  <p>
    For custom robots: create a robot in your DingTalk group, then copy the webhook URL here.
    Security options are configured in DingTalk and, if needed, in the Security Settings below.
  </p>
  <p>
    For internal enterprise robots: obtain the webhook address from the internal robot FAQ,
    then paste it here.
